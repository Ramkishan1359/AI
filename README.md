# Health-Danger-Alert-System-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This application uses an Artificial Neural Network that was trained on 5 features (Age, Heartbeat, Systolic, Diastolic and Sugar) to predict whether the given patient is likely to pose a health problem or not.

This notebook contains training and testing components that were programmed in python. Several external libraries were also used like pandas, scikit-learn, keras and matplot.
